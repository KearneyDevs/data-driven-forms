# Data Driven Forms with React

The idea of this small project is to create forms, labels, elements and functions all from an array of objects. The goal is to use minimal code to achieve it using Reactjs.

I have not thought out all the steps as of yet, but will document each step as I go.

# Method One

## Using FormData and Object.fromEntries()

### FormData() constructor

An HTML form element â€” when specified, the FormData object will be populated with the form's current keys/values using the name property of each element for the keys and their submitted value for the values. It will also encode file input content.

### Object.fromEntries()

The `Object.fromEntries()` static method transforms a list of key-value pairs into an object.

```js
function handleSubmit(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  const data = new FormData(e.target);
  console.log(Object.fromEntries(data.entries()));
}

return (
  <div className="app">
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <FormInput name="username" placeholder="Username" />
      <FormInput name="email" placeholder="Email" />
      <FormInput name="fullname" placeholder="Full Name" />
      <button>Submit</button>
    </form>
  </div>
);
```

Above I have created a handleSubmit function which will fire when the submit button is clicked. Within the function I have assigned a const data variable to `new FormData(e.target)`. From there I then pass in the e.target and then apply the data.entries to the Object.fromEntries method.

Now to confirm, the entries is within the FormData, see below that I have done another console.log within the submit function which will show the entries iterator.

```js
function handleSubmit(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  const data = new FormData(e.target);
  console.log(data);
}
```

We need to be able to access the key value pairs within entries. To do so we then use Object methods which transforms the key value pairs into an object like below when submit is selected.

```js
function handleSubmit(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  const data = new FormData(e.target);
  console.log(Object.fromEntries(data.entries()));
}
```

```json
{
  "username": "John",
  "email": "johndoe@gmail.com",
  "fullname": "John Doe"
}
```

I found this way to be quite clean, but would like to explore other paths to see what the best possible solution might be. Again, I am using react, so I want to lean on what it has to offer.

# Method Two

## Using the useState hook

While we could use multiple useState hooks for each respective field, I thought it best to explore using just one piece of state that would be an object that stores the key value pairs and update them accordingly with each input field.

I also thought it best to create an array of objects, each containing the key value pairs required for each input.

```js
const [values, setValues] = useState({
  username: "",
  email: "",
  fullname: "",
  birthday: "",
  password: "",
});

const inputs = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "username",
    type: "text",
    placeholder: "Username",
    label: "Username",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "email",
    type: "email",
    placeholder: "Email",
    label: "Email",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: "fullname",
    type: "text",
    placeholder: "Full Name",
    label: "Full Name",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    name: "birthday",
    type: "text",
    placeholder: "Birthday",
    label: "Birthday",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    name: "password",
    type: "password",
    placeholder: "Password",
    label: "Password",
  },
];
```

This is pretty straight forward, from here I would then map out the FormInput component based on the array of inputs.

```js
{
  inputs.map((input) => (
    <FormInput
      key={input.id}
      {...input}
      value={values[input.name]}
      onChange={handleChange}
    />
  ));
}
```

Here is how the FormInput looks at the moment using the array of objects (inputs) as props.

```js
const FormInput = (props) => {
  const { label, onChange, id, ...inputProps } = props;
  return (
    <div className="formInput">
      <label>{label}</label>
      <input {...inputProps} onChange={onChange} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default FormInput;
```

The component takes in four props that are destructured.

- label - comes from each object key value pair of label.
- onChange - is a function that comes from the parent component app which sets the setValues state. (More on that below)
- id - comes from each object key value pair of id.
- ...inputProps - is a spread of the object being passed in as a prop. This doesn't include the id or the label as these are being passed in as separate props.

How the handleChange function works

```js
function handleChange(e) {
  setValues({ ...values, [e.target.name]: e.target.value });
}
```
**Note: The above needs updated to use previous state as it will rely on the previous state. This is best practice.**

This is passed in as a prop called onChange, which then runs whenever the input within the FormInput component is updated. The function takes in the event and we then set the setValues state taking in a spread of the `...values` state and then applying the typed value as the value against the key name.

So for example if we type in the Username field which the `e.target.name` will be username, the value of that key will be updated to with what has been typed. So how do we know that name is username? We passed it in as part of our props from the inputs array of objects which you can see below.

On the input component we spread the input props and use it for the attributes of the input. For example:

```html
<div class="formInput">
  <label>Username</label>
  <input
    name="username"
    type="text"
    placeholder="Username"
    value="Shane Kearney"
  />
</div>
```
